## SANSA

Training SANSA on Yambda-500M with Listens, on Yambda-5B with Likes and on Yambda-5B with Listens is infeasible
due to the memory explosion during sparse matrix multiplication.

For example, given the base weights density of \\(d=5 \cdot 10^{-5}\\), the sparse matrix multiplication for Yambda-500M with Listens requires nearly
\\(N_{events} \cdot |I|^2 \cdot d = 0.5 \cdot 10^9 \cdot (3 \cdot 10^6) ^ 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10^{-5} = 2.3 \cdot 10^{17}\\) operations.

One may observe that the good solution is to try to reduce the weights density. However given the results on Yambda-50M with Listens, further reducing density would collapse the modelâ€™s capacity, it becomes obvious that it is just practically futile. 

Unfortunately the main SANSA repository is not optimized for large datasets, so even on the Yambda-50M with Listens at least 100GB of RAM is required.
